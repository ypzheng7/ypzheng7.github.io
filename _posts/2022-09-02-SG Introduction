It felt like yesterday that I had just landed in Singapore for my study abroad. I always knew that I wanted to study abroad in Asia since freshman year of college. China was my number one destination because (1) I am Chinese, and I want to relearn my roots and culture (2) I should better my Mandarin speaking skills and (3) I really enjoy Chinese foods. After the pandemic, the option to study in China was far-fetched and I had limited countries to work with. 

Luckily, Singapore was available, and I have always been fascinated by the fast-growing economy tied in with their sustainability efforts. It also checked off all the boxes I wanted for China! (Let’s not forget the amazing opportunity to study in Asia’s top university!) Singapore quickly became my top destination. 

The beginning of my journey was difficult. Granted, I should have prepared earlier but there was also a lack of resources and experiences from students post-Covid. I want to document my experience and the lessons I’ve learned for future students that are looking to study abroad or do an internship in Singapore.
